Assignment1_Qn1 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
write a C program that calculates the average of marks got by a student in three subjects ir Phy, Chem and MTC. Assume for eacj subject four different tests were conducted ie assignments, course work, mid term, and end of term exams 

the question asked us to provide a code that does arithmetic operations (average) and below is the expected results 
.............................................................................
./Assignment1_Qn1                      
the average of math = 57.50
the average of chemistry = 62.50
the average of physics = 66.50   
..............................................................................

this is got by suming up the marks obtained from each of the tests and then dividing it through by the numbr of tests done just like it is shown in the code 

Assignment1_Qn2
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
write a C program that accepts a group N domestic animals and a group of X wild animals. Your program should print N+X animals after entering each group 

the question is asking us to jwrite a code that will prompt us to enter the number of animals both domestic and wild (N and X respectively). The code sud store this infomation as an array and then runs a loop which will help promot u to list them depending on the number of the animals u ahve entered. the other loop will help it run list the animals u have entered... all this is done using the 2D arrays.. 
the out put can look as below
...........................................................................
./Asignment1_Qn2 
please enter the number of domestic animals: 3
please enter the number of wild animals: 3
please list the domestic animals:
animal1 cow
animal2 goat
animal3 sheep 
please list the wild animals:
 animal1 lion
animal2 leopard
animal3 elephant

All animals incude: cow
goat
sheep
lion
leopard
elephant
.............................................................................

the code prompts u to feed it infomation, it stores the information as arrays and uses looping and array allocation to print out the inputs
